This is going to be for a game I am writing 
My game is going to be out a marine that is left alone as he fell off the boat and he is trying to find memebers of his squadrant. He has two paths he can take but he has to either give up and live with someone that he stumbles upon or he will end up finding his squadrant and he lives on.
